<description>The robots of the Robo Rally automobile factory spend their weekdays toiling at the assembly line. They put in hard hours building high-speed supercars they never get to see in action. But on Saturday nights, the factory becomes a world of mad machines and dangerous schemes as these robots engage in their own epic race.It takes speed, wits, and dirty tricks to become a racing legend! Each player chooses a robot and directs its moves by playing cards. Chaos ensues as all players reveal the cards they've chosen. Players face obstacles like industrial lasers, gaping pits, and moving conveyor belts -- but those can also be used to their advantage! Each player aims to make it to each of the checkpoints in numerical order. The first player to reach all of the checkpoints wins. (source: &lt;a target='_blank' href=&quot;http://avalonhill.wizards.com/games/robo-rally/comingsoon&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer noopener&quot;&gt;http://avalonhill.wizards.com/games/robo-rally/comingsoon&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In RoboRally players each control a different robot in a race through a dangerous factory floor. Several goals will be placed on the board and you must navigate your robot to them in a specific order. The boards can be combined in several different ways to accommodate different player counts and races can be as long or as short as player's desire.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In general, players will first fill all of their robot's &amp;quot;registers&amp;quot; with facedown movement cards. This happens simultaneously and there is a time element involved. If you don't act fast enough you are forced to place cards randomly to fill the rest. Then, starting with the first register, everyone reveals their card. The card with the highest number moves first. After everyone resolves their movement they reveal the next card and so on. Examples of movement cards may be to turn 90 degrees left or right, move forward 2 spaces, or move backward 1 space though there are a bigger variety than that. You can plan a perfect route, but if another robot runs into you it can push you off course. This can be disastrous since you can't reprogram any cards to fix it!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Robots fire lasers and factory elements resolve after each movement and robots may become damaged. If they take enough damage certain movement cards become fixed and can no longer be changed. If they take more they may be destroyed entirely. The first robot to claim all the goals in the correct order wins, though some may award points and play tournament style.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game was reprinted by Avalon Hill (Hasbro/WotC) in 2005.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;UPC 742818050029&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>

<comment username="1000rpm" rating="9">Rating after 1 play of a 2 player game.
It was fun. It was chaos. And that with only 2 players.
It took longer than expected, but I loved it.  I can see how with a lot of players/a long map it could get frustrating/incredibly long, but I&#039;d still like to give that a go.

Second game with 7 players.  We didn&#039;t finish.  But it was fun.  I realised it probably isn&#039;t a good idea to sabotage your robot with a load of red wine. It really doesn&#039;t work as well.

Have played quite a lot now and just really think it is a great fun game.  Just played a short, deadly, 6 player game.  Only 2 survived.  Loads of fun.
Upgraded to a 9.</comment>
<comment username="100pcBlade" rating="6">The game is pretty unique and can be great fun. It&#039;s also at risk of becoming long, drawn out &amp; tedious. If you can avoid this then it is recommended. Just be prepared to put up with the odd nightmare game</comment>

I don&#039;t like games where players can die early and have to watch the other players finish the game. Someone else here says it well, &quot;too long and too light.&quot; Plenty of other games I&#039;d play before this one.</comment>

<comment username="abdiel" rating="9">I&#039;m drawn to racing games but there are very few good ones.  Robo Rally is the best racing game I&#039;ve played, and a great game in general.  Puzzling out the most efficient use of cards while trying to predict where your opponents are going to end up makes for a fun a challenging game.

There is a learning curve regarding being able to visualize where the cards in your hand will land you on the board.  Until you know how to drive your robot it&#039;s best if you stick to simple one board tracks.</comment>

<comment username="Achire" rating="8">5/13/2018 - First play rating, so subject to change. Very entertaining and fun. It does require a certain type of thinking to program the actions effectively, but it&#039;s not terribly difficult and the mistakes are hilarious. Also, the bot powers really make things more tricky in interesting ways. I need to play it more to really master the strategy of the game, but I can definitely see why this a classic. I was worried it might not seem very interesting after Mechs vs. Minions, but I was mistaken, it&#039;s a very different game and quite special.</comment>

Obwohl dann machts erst Spaß ;-)</comment>
<comment username="Actherion" rating="7">Great fun, especially when players are close enough that they influence each other. Occasionally, a player can get off to a fast start (thanks to the luck factor involved) which reduces interactivity, but all of the games I&#039;ve played have been fairly close at the end, so I&#039;m not sure it&#039;s that big of a problem. The game can be extremely frantic, and player elimination can become a problem, so it&#039;s probably best to take this game in limited amounts</comment>

But do I only like the puzzle aspect or will I like the game?</comment>
<comment username="adam.skinner" rating="7.5">It&#039;s like Logo (that old kid&#039;s computer programming language, remember?), only now your turtle is a killer robot, racing towards the final goal.

Fun, and easy to get confused due to turns and board interaction (there are things that turn and move you on the board, as well as other robots that can push you around).</comment>
<comment username="Adam78" rating="8">A brilliant streamlined system of programming, and a great race game. I loved my first play and can see the huge variety which is present in the multiple boards and options. I imagine AP could set in with some players and slow the game down, but with the right crowd this game is fantastic.</comment>
<comment username="adamb2k9" rating="9">Move, turn, shoot... WATCH OUT!!!</comment>
<comment username="adambadura" rating="5">2022-05-08 (rate 5):

I was interested in the game because I like the mechanic, the theme seemed fine, and [person=14] as the designer attracted me as well. Also, I had the impression this is a well-established classic in its category.

However, after a few games, I grew skeptical. With a little number of players, the board was too empty. With more players, the moves were too chaotic. While lack of control was an immense impression.

In the end, I decided there are other games with the mechanics ([boardgamemechanic=2953]) that I like more and got rid of this one.</comment>

<comment username="adamscott" rating="6">I could see this being fun in the right circumstances (ie playing with children), but the level of chaos is bound to frustrate many.</comment>
<comment username="adamtaylorhouston" rating="9">Awesome programming game. Easy to learn, the more people play, the more chaos and fun it will be.</comment>
<comment username="adamw" rating="6">Lovely game in many ways - actually better with more players. Fun-loving, but not terribly strategic. For a good time, it&#039;s good. For a good game it&#039;s.... feh. My variant now is to play one card at a time. Sure, it&#039;s really easy, but it removes the frustration of this game and still maintains the fun at least for me. Feels more strategic too and substantially less chaotic. Sold it.</comment>
<comment username="adamxt" rating="6">Some people can direct their robot to the goals with no missteps or confusion. I have infinite respect for those people. My robots bump into walls and lasers, but I still love the chaos.</comment>

Again, here&#039;s a game that is at its best with more players due to the chaotic nature of the game.

2016-05-24
Robo Rally is one of those games in which the journey is more important than destination. This is due to the extremely chaotic nature of the game. Your plans are most guaranteed to fail.

But the magic of the game is in failing. It is like throwing things down into a gorge just to see what happens. For non-serious gamers Robo Rally offers great laughs and fun.</comment>

<comment username="Admiral Fisher" rating="5">Despite the fact that I&#039;m rubbish at this, I did enjoy it a bit and think it is very replayable.  A lot of fun and quite a bit of a brain-burner when you get near the fast conveyors and twizzles.</comment>
<comment username="AdmiralGT" rating="9">Really enjoy RoboRally and one of the games that got me back into board gaming. Prefer playing on smaller boards to get more interaction and can find large maps just degenerate into a race for the flags with little interaction which is the most fun part of the game.</comment>
<comment username="Adria" rating="8">Traded away because it never hit the table.</comment>
<comment username="Adrian Hill" rating="7.5">One of the few games that gets better with more people. Only play with 4 or more. Great fun. </comment>
<comment username="adularia25" rating="6">Can&#039;t really give it a good rating as I&#039;ve only played one game.  

Interesting premise.  Several programmer friends of mine love the game, and so a friend of a friend brought it out and we finally got to play it.  They said that all programmers love it... but my husband wasn&#039;t too thrilled by it.  Sure, you &quot;program&quot; your robot, but the entire game is about spacial awareness.  I&#039;m great at that... my husband, not so much.  

The game would have gone better if all of us had been allowed to read the rules.  Two of the people playing had played it many times before, and three of us (me included) had never played it before.  We would have benefited from having more things explained.  But that is not a failing of the game, so much as a failing of the people we were playing with...

That said, my husband and I didn&#039;t do too poorly.  We were playing the &quot;tag the flag&quot; gametype where we had to go from one flag to another, in order from one to three, and the first bot to reach three would win.  Everyone in the game at least made it to the second flag.  Some of us got almost to three.  And again, would have been better if we had known more of the rules.

Hopefully next time (if there is a next time) will be better.</comment>
<comment username="Advocator" rating="7">I&#039;ve yet to play this game sober.  I&#039;m sure it prove more strategic if I were, but drinking just makes this game fun.  Nothing quite like watching your friends twist from side to side in their chair trying to figure out just what the heck their cards are going to do.</comment>
<comment username="aerial7" rating="7.5">?CULL
A good game but one best enjoyed very infrequently;   you don&#039;t want the novelty to wear off.   A few times a year allows you to appreciate the game;  any more than that and I&#039;m afraid it would degenerate into tedium....</comment>

<comment username="AFABBI" rating="5">This reminds me of a cross between the Hannah Barbara racing cartoon and the movie short circuits Johnny 5. It was the game Richard Garfield was pitching without success when he ended up having to fall back on his backup prototype a little game known as mtg. Robo Rally is about a crazy robot race through a series of modular boards with different kinds of obstacles and environmental conditions in order to be the first bot to take flags in each board in sequential order. The catch is you have to program your bots and then execute the actions in order so this leads to all kinds of crazy shenanigans. Especially when you damage other robots and start locking certain commands into their tableu. Robo rally is a good racing game. As far as race games go, I think it is probably one of the better ones.</comment>

<comment username="Aganju" rating="7.4">played at least 30 times. I like the style of the game, with lots of planning ahead and complexity. Also, being able to crush others is fun. I not only own that (the original WotC), but I bought it (huge difference!), and I have all extensions.</comment>
<comment username="agent easy" rating="7">This game is far from perfect, but I always have such a good time when I play that I have to assume there is more here than the sum of it&#039;s parts. I have played both the old and new version, but the one I own is the new one (which, despite a setback in component quality, is worth owning for the suggested course layouts alone)</comment>
<comment username="AgentOddball" rating="6">(Sold to make room on my shelves.)

A fun game that always gets laughter at the table.  Plays better with more players.  There&#039;s a little bit of a problem with runaway leaders, though.  If someone can break away from the pack, they&#039;ll have a much easier time for the rest of the game.

Update: I&#039;ve had to bump this down to a 6 for my group.  The runaway leader is a huge problem with the number of players we are able to bring together.  Maybe if we could get more to the table, it would be harder to break away from the pack.</comment>

Mmm...computer programming.  Always fun, but I hate shuffling that huge stack every time.  Can have serious runaway leader problems if you use more than one board.</comment>

  description: 'The robots of the Robo Rally automobile factory spend their weekdays toiling at the assembly line. They put in hard hours building high-speed supercars they never get to see in action. But on Saturday nights, the factory becomes a world of mad machines and dangerous schemes as these robots engage in their own epic race.It takes speed, wits, and dirty tricks to become a racing legend! Each player chooses a robot and directs its moves by playing cards. Chaos ensues as all players reveal the cards they\'ve chosen. Players face obstacles like industrial lasers, gaping pits, and moving conveyor belts -- but those can also be used to their advantage! Each player aims to make it to each of the checkpoints in numerical order. The first player to reach all of the checkpoints wins. (source: <a target=\'_blank\' href="http://avalonhill.wizards.com/games/robo-rally/comingsoon" rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener">http://avalonhill.wizards.com/games/robo-rally/comingsoon</a>)<br/><br/>In RoboRally players each control a different robot in a race through a dangerous factory floor. Several goals will be placed on the board and you must navigate your robot to them in a specific order. The boards can be combined in several different ways to accommodate different player counts and races can be as long or as short as player\'s desire.<br/><br/>In general, players will first fill all of their robot\'s &quot;registers&quot; with facedown movement cards. This happens simultaneously and there is a time element involved. If you don\'t act fast enough you are forced to place cards randomly to fill the rest. Then, starting with the first register, everyone reveals their card. The card with the highest number moves first. After everyone resolves their movement they reveal the next card and so on. Examples of movement cards may be to turn 90 degrees left or right, move forward 2 spaces, or move backward 1 space though there are a bigger variety than that. You can plan a perfect route, but if another robot runs into you it can push you off course. This can be disastrous since you can\'t reprogram any cards to fix it!<br/><br/>Robots fire lasers and factory elements resolve after each movement and robots may become damaged. If they take enough damage certain movement cards become fixed and can no longer be changed. If they take more they may be destroyed entirely. The first robot to claim all the goals in the correct order wins, though some may award points and play tournament style.<br/><br/>The game was reprinted by Avalon Hill (Hasbro/WotC) in 2005.<br/><br/>UPC 742818050029<br/><br/>',

      comment: 'I&#039;m drawn to racing games but there are very few good ones.  Robo Rally is the best racing game I&#039;ve played, and a great game in general.  Puzzling out the most efficient use of cards while trying to predict where your opponents are going to end up makes for a fun a challenging game.\n\nThere is a learning curve regarding being able to visualize where the cards in your hand will land you on the board.  Until you know how to drive your robot it&#039;s best if you stick to simple one board tracks.'

It does require a certain type of thinking to program the actions effectively, but it&#039;s not terribly difficult and the mistakes are hilarious. Also, the bot powers really make things more tricky in interesting ways. I need to play it more to really master the strategy of the game, but I can definitely see why this a classic. I was worried it might not seem very interesting after Mechs vs. Minions, but I was mistaken, it&#039;s a very different game and quite special.'

Occasionally, a player can get off to a fast start (thanks to the luck factor involved) which reduces interactivity, but all of the games I&#039;ve played have been fairly close at the end, so I&#039;m not sure it&#039;s that big of a problem. The game can be extremely frantic, and player elimination can become a problem, so it&#039;s probably best to take this game in limited amounts'

Also, I had the impression this is a well-established classic in its category.\n\nHowever, after a few games, I grew skeptical. With a little number of players, the board was too empty. With more players, the moves were too chaotic. While lack of control was an immense impression.\n\nIn the end, I decided there are other games with the mechanics ([boardgamemechanic=2953]) that I like more and got rid of this one.'

      comment: 'Can&#039;t really give it a good rating as I&#039;ve only played one game.  \n\nInteresting premise.  Several programmer friends of mine love the game, and so a friend of a friend brought it out and we finally got to play it.  They said that all programmers love it... but my husband wasn&#039;t too thrilled by it.  Sure, you "program" your robot, but the entire game is about spacial awareness.  I&#039;m great at that... my husband, not so much.  \n\nThe game would have gone better if all of us had been allowed to read the rules.  Two of the people playing had played it many times before, and three of us (me included) had never played it before.  We would have benefited from having more things explained.  But that is not a failing of the game, so much as a failing of the people we were playing with...\n\nThat said, my husband and I didn&#039;t do too poorly.  We were playing the "tag the flag" gametype where we had to go from one flag to another, in order from one to three, and the first bot to reach three would win.  Everyone in the game at least made it to the second flag.  Some of us got almost to three.  And again, would have been better if we had known more of the rules.\n\nHopefully next time (if there is a next time) will be better.'

      comment: 'This reminds me of a cross between the Hannah Barbara racing cartoon and the movie short circuits Johnny 5. It was the game Richard Garfield was pitching without success when he ended up having to fall back on his backup prototype a little game known as mtg. Robo Rally is about a crazy robot race through a series of modular boards with different kinds of obstacles and environmental conditions in order to be the first bot to take flags in each board in sequential order. The catch is you have to program your bots and then execute the actions in order so this leads to all kinds of crazy shenanigans. Especially when you damage other robots and start locking certain commands into their tableu. Robo rally is a good racing game. As far as race games go, I think it is probably one of the better ones.'
