# BGG API Parser

## Description

The goal of this package is to provide a simple way to parse the XML data provided by the [BoardGameGeek API](https://boardgamegeek.com/wiki/page/BGG_XML_API). It takes an opinionated approach to the parsed data, renaming properies and culling properties that are not useful for the majority of use cases. The package was primarily written to support my own private board game collection application, but I hope it can be useful to others as well.

Feel free to open an issue or pull request if you have any suggestions or find any bugs.
